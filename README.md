# Renesas Power Chip firmware upgrade utils
# ISL-UTIL

Configuration files(*.hex type) are provided by hardware colleagues. 


When generating the configuration file they need to specify the channel(Configuration ID) to burn,the final effective Configuration ID is based on the hardware design.


sudo ./isl-uitl i2cbus slave-addr device [file-name]

    i2cbus: 
    
      the i2c channel host link to device, in SG2042 Pisces multi socket server:
      
            0: SG2042 CPU0 I2C0
            
            4: SG2042 CPU1 I2C0
    
    slave-addr:
     
      the addr slave address is base on hardware design, it is best to be told in advance by the hardware colleagues.
            
            0x5C: in SG2042 Pisces
    
    device:
    
      show the device you want to burn
      
            0: ISL68127
            
            1: ISL68224
    
    [file-name]: 
      
      the configuration hex file you want to burn.

Example:
  1. To inquire the power chip's device id, reversion id and the NVM slots(remaining number of programming times):

       sudo ./isl-util 0 0x5C 0

  2. In addition to the above functions, you want to burn the configuration hex file to power chip(upgrade the chip) :

       sudo ./isl-util 0 0x5C 0 file-name
